# Estudos Docker - Vagrant

## Iniciando a máquina virtual
```
vagrant up
```

```
$ vagrant status
Current machine states:

docker.hl.local           running (virtualbox)

The VM is running. To stop this VM, you can run `vagrant halt` to
shut it down forcefully, or you can run `vagrant suspend` to simply
suspend the virtual machine. In either case, to restart it again,
simply run `vagrant up`.
```


```
$ vagrant ssh docker.hl.local
```
